    accessing the element with the ID "demo" before the document has finished
    loading. The script is placed in the head section of your HTML, and it's
    executed before the rest of the HTML is parsed. When the script runs, the
    element with the ID "demo" hasn't been created yet. To prevent this we are
    moving the script below. -->
